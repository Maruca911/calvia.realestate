    question: 'What is the typical property buying process in Calvia, Mallorca?',
    answer: `The buying process in Calvia generally follows these stages. First, you obtain an NIE (Numero de Identidad de Extranjero), which is a foreigner identification number required for any property transaction in Spain. Your agent or a local gestor can help arrange this. Once you find a property, you sign a reservation contract and pay a small deposit, typically between 3,000 and 10,000 euros, to take the property off the market. Your lawyer then conducts due diligence, checking the property registry (Registro de la Propiedad), confirming there are no outstanding debts or charges, verifying planning permissions, and ensuring the property description matches the cadastral records. Next comes the private purchase contract (contrato de arras), where you pay 10% of the purchase price as a deposit. This is a binding agreement — if you withdraw, you lose the deposit; if the seller withdraws, they must return double the deposit. Finally, the sale is completed at a notary office where the public deed (escritura publica) is signed and the balance is paid. The deed is then registered at the Land Registry. The entire process typically takes 6 to 12 weeks from accepted offer to completion.`,

    question: 'What taxes and fees should I budget for when buying property in Calvia?',
    answer: `As a buyer in Calvia, you should budget approximately 10 to 13 percent on top of the purchase price for taxes and fees. The main cost is the property transfer tax (Impuesto de Transmisiones Patrimoniales, or ITP), which in the Balearic Islands is currently set at 8% for properties up to 400,000 euros, 9% for the portion between 400,000 and 600,000 euros, 10% for the portion between 600,000 and 1,000,000 euros, and 11.5% above one million euros. If you are buying a new-build property directly from a developer, you pay 10% IVA (VAT) instead of ITP, plus 1.5% stamp duty (Actos Juridicos Documentados). Notary fees typically range from 600 to 1,200 euros. Land Registry fees are around 400 to 800 euros. Legal fees for a conveyancing lawyer are usually 1% of the purchase price plus VAT, with a minimum of around 1,500 euros. If you use a mortgage, add the bank's arrangement fee (typically 0.5 to 1%) and a mortgage valuation survey fee of 300 to 600 euros. We strongly recommend having an independent surveyor inspect the property, which costs between 500 and 1,500 euros depending on the property size.`,

    question: 'Can non-residents and non-EU citizens buy property in Calvia?',
    answer: `Yes, there are no legal restrictions on foreigners — whether EU or non-EU citizens — buying residential property in Calvia or anywhere in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. You will need to obtain an NIE (foreigner identification number), open a Spanish bank account for the transaction, and appoint a fiscal representative if you are non-EU and will not be tax resident in Spain. The process is identical for all nationalities. However, note that in 2023 the Balearic Government introduced regulations limiting the purchase of property by non-residents in certain circumstances, specifically targeting speculative buying. It is essential to work with an up-to-date local lawyer who understands the current rules. Non-EU buyers should also be aware that property ownership alone does not grant residency rights in Spain. If you wish to live in Spain for more than 90 days in any 180-day period, you will need to apply for a visa or residency permit separately. The Golden Visa programme, which previously granted residency for property investments of 500,000 euros or more, was suspended for new applicants in 2024 — consult a specialist immigration lawyer for the latest alternatives.`,

    question: 'What is the Lex Beckham tax regime and does it apply to property buyers in Calvia?',
    answer: `The Lex Beckham regime, formally known as the Special Tax Regime for Inbound Workers (Regimen Especial de Trabajadores Desplazados) under Article 93 of the Spanish Income Tax Act, allows qualifying new tax residents in Spain to be taxed at a flat rate of 24% on their Spanish-sourced income up to 600,000 euros for the first six tax years. Above that threshold, income is taxed at 47%. Crucially, under this regime you are treated as a non-resident for tax purposes, meaning your worldwide income outside Spain is generally not taxed in Spain (except for income from Spanish sources). To qualify, you must not have been a Spanish tax resident in the previous five years, and you must have a genuine reason for moving to Spain, such as an employment contract with a Spanish company or being appointed as a director of a Spanish entity. Self-employed individuals may also qualify under certain conditions introduced in the 2023 Startups Law. This regime does not directly affect property purchase taxes — the ITP and other acquisition costs are the same regardless. However, it can significantly reduce your ongoing income tax burden if you are relocating to Calvia for work, making the overall cost of living and owning property in Mallorca much more attractive.`,

    question: 'How do I obtain an NIE (foreigner identification number) for buying property in Calvia?',
    answer: `The NIE (Numero de Identidad de Extranjero) is mandatory for any financial transaction in Spain, including property purchases, opening a bank account, and connecting utilities. There are two ways to obtain one. First, you can apply in person at the National Police station (Comisaria de Policia) in Palma de Mallorca or at the Foreigners Office. You will need to fill in the EX-15 form, provide your passport plus a photocopy, bring a passport-sized photograph, and pay the tax fee (Tasa 790, currently around 12 euros) at a Spanish bank beforehand. Appointments can be booked through the Sede Electronica website, though slots fill up quickly. Second, you can apply from your home country at the nearest Spanish consulate or embassy, which avoids the need to travel to Spain just for the NIE. Processing times vary from a few days to several weeks. Many buyers grant a power of attorney (poder notarial) to their Spanish lawyer, who can then obtain the NIE on their behalf without the buyer needing to be present. We recommend starting the NIE application as early as possible, as delays can hold up the entire purchase timeline.`,

    question: 'What mortgage options are available for non-resident buyers in Calvia?',
    answer: `Spanish banks do offer mortgages to non-resident buyers, though the terms differ from those available to residents. Typically, non-residents can borrow up to 60 to 70 percent of the property valuation (not necessarily the purchase price), compared to 80% for residents. Interest rates for non-residents are generally between 2.5% and 4.5% depending on the bank, the loan amount, and whether you choose a fixed or variable rate. Variable rates are usually linked to the 12-month Euribor plus a margin of 1.5 to 2.5 percentage points. Fixed rates offer more certainty and have become increasingly popular. Loan terms typically range from 15 to 25 years, with the mortgage needing to be fully repaid before the borrower reaches 70 to 75 years of age. Banks will require a valuation survey (tasacion) conducted by an approved valuation company, proof of income (usually two years of tax returns and bank statements), a credit report from your home country, and life insurance covering at least the outstanding loan balance. Some buyers prefer to arrange financing in their home country against existing assets, which can sometimes be faster and offer better rates. A specialist mortgage broker with experience in Balearic Island transactions can save you considerable time by identifying the best offer across multiple banks.`,

    question: 'How long does a property purchase typically take to complete in Calvia?',
    answer: `The timeline from finding a property to receiving the keys varies depending on several factors, but a typical transaction in Calvia takes 8 to 12 weeks. If you already have your NIE, a Spanish bank account, and financing pre-approved, the process can move faster — sometimes completing in as little as 4 to 6 weeks. The reservation stage takes 1 to 2 weeks. Due diligence by your lawyer, including registry checks, verification of urban planning compliance, and reviewing community of owners documents, takes 2 to 4 weeks. If you need a mortgage, the bank valuation and approval process adds another 3 to 6 weeks. The private contract (arras) is signed once due diligence is satisfactory, and a completion date is agreed, usually 4 to 8 weeks later. On completion day, you attend the notary with the seller, sign the public deed, transfer the funds, and receive the keys. After completion, your lawyer handles the registration at the Land Registry and the change of utility contracts. Properties that are part of an estate (inheritance), have complex planning histories, or involve rural land (rustica) can take longer due to additional administrative requirements. We always recommend starting your legal preparation — NIE, bank account, lawyer appointment — before you begin property viewings to avoid unnecessary delays.`,

    question: 'What should I look for when choosing an estate agency in Calvia?',
    answer: `Calvia has a large number of estate agencies, ranging from international franchises to boutique local firms. When choosing who to work with, consider the following. First, check that the agency is properly registered and holds the required licence to operate in the Balearic Islands. Second, look for agents with specific expertise in your target village — an agency specialising in Son Vida luxury estates may not be the best choice if you are looking for a family apartment in Santa Ponsa. Third, ask about their listing inventory: exclusive listings (where only one agency markets the property) often mean better access and negotiating power, while shared listings through MLS-type networks give broader coverage. Fourth, evaluate their communication standards — do they respond promptly, do they speak your language, and do they provide detailed property information including energy certificates, community fees, and cadastral references? Fifth, ask for references from previous clients, particularly those with a similar profile to yours. A good agency will also have strong relationships with local lawyers, notaries, banks, and surveyors, making the entire purchase process smoother. Our matching service connects you with agencies that have proven track records in your specific area and price bracket, saving you the trial-and-error of contacting multiple firms yourself.`,
