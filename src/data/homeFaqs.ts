    question: 'What exactly does Calvia Real Estate do?',
    answer: 'We are a free property matching service based in the Calvia municipality, Mallorca. Instead of contacting dozens of agencies yourself, you fill in one form telling us what you need — and we match you to 2-3 expert local agencies who already have properties or buyers matching your profile. Think of us as a concierge sitting between you and the best agents in the region.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where is Calvia and why is it popular with property buyers?',
    answer: 'Calvia is a municipality on the southwest coast of Mallorca, spanning from the luxury enclave of Son Vida near Palma all the way to Paguera in the west. It includes some of the island\'s most sought-after villages: Bendinat, Portals Nous, Illetes, Santa Ponsa, Palmanova, Sol de Mallorca, Costa den Blanes, and Calvia Village itself. The area is popular because it combines world-class beaches, excellent international schools, top golf courses, a strong expat community, and easy access to Palma and the airport — all within a 15-to-30-minute drive.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the matching service really free?',
    answer: 'Yes, completely. There is no cost to buyers or sellers who use our service. We earn a referral fee from the agency only when a successful transaction closes. You are never invoiced, and there is no hidden commission added to the sale or rental price. The agencies absorb our fee as part of their standard marketing budget.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly will I hear back after submitting my form?',
    answer: 'Our team reviews every enquiry within 24 hours on business days. Most leads receive their first agency introduction within 48 hours. If your requirements are very specific — for example, a luxury off-market villa in Son Vida above 5 million euros — the matching process may take slightly longer as we vet agencies with the right inventory. You can speed things up by booking a free consultation via Calendly on the thank-you page.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of property can you help with?',
    answer: 'We cover all residential property types across the Calvia municipality: villas, apartments, townhouses, fincas (traditional Mallorcan country houses), plots of land, and penthouses. We assist with purchases, long-term rentals, and short-term holiday lets. Whether you are looking for a 200,000-euro apartment in Palmanova or a 10-million-euro seafront estate in Illetes, we have agencies in our network who specialise in your segment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this service if I am based outside of Spain?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. A large proportion of our users are international buyers and sellers based in Germany, the UK, Scandinavia, the US, and beyond. The entire process — form submission, agency introductions, and initial consultations — can be handled remotely. Many agencies in our network are fluent in English, German, and Spanish, and some offer additional languages. The agencies can arrange video viewings, and your lawyer can handle power of attorney for remote completions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What languages do the partner agencies speak?',
    answer: 'Our agency network covers English, German, Spanish, French, and several Scandinavian languages. When you submit your enquiry, we match you with agencies that speak your preferred language. If you have a specific language requirement, mention it in the "Special Conditions" field of the form and we will prioritise accordingly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I book a free consultation?',
    answer: 'After you submit your buyer or seller form, you will be taken to a confirmation page that includes a link to book a free 15-minute consultation via Calendly. Alternatively, you can reach us directly on WhatsApp using the green chat button visible on every page. The consultation is an opportunity to discuss your requirements in detail and ensure we match you to the right agencies.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is my personal data handled?',
    answer: 'We take data protection seriously. Your information is processed in accordance with GDPR regulations and only shared with the specific partner agencies matched to your enquiry. We do not sell your data to third parties, and you can request deletion at any time by contacting us via WhatsApp or email. Our full privacy policy is available on request.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Calvia compare to other areas of Mallorca for property investment?',
    answer: 'Calvia consistently ranks among the top three municipalities in Mallorca for property price appreciation. Average prices per square metre are between 4,500 and 8,000 euros depending on the village, with premium locations like Son Vida and Bendinat exceeding 10,000 euros per square metre. Compared to Palma (higher density, less green space) and the northeast (more rural, longer airport transfers), Calvia offers a balance of lifestyle, accessibility, and investment stability that appeals to both end-users and investors.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I am not satisfied with the agency match?',
    answer: 'If the initial agency introduction does not feel right, let us know via WhatsApp or email and we will re-evaluate your criteria and suggest alternative agencies from our network. There is no obligation to work with any agency we introduce. Our goal is a productive long-term match, not a forced introduction. In rare cases where a specialist requirement cannot be met within our current network, we will be transparent about that and recommend other avenues.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use your service for commercial property in Calvia?',
    answer: 'Our primary focus is residential property — homes, apartments, villas, and land for private use. We do not currently specialise in commercial property such as offices, retail units, or hotel developments. However, if your commercial enquiry relates to a mixed-use project or a property that could serve both residential and commercial purposes (for example, a finca conversion), reach out via WhatsApp and we will advise whether our network can assist.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work with property developers and new-build projects?',
    answer: 'Yes. Several agencies in our network have direct relationships with established developers building in the Calvia municipality, including projects in Santa Ponsa, Sol de Mallorca, and Son Vida. If you are interested in off-plan purchases or new-build villas, mention this in your buyer form and we will prioritise agencies with access to developer stock and pre-launch pricing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between your service and a traditional estate agent?',
    answer: 'A traditional estate agent works for the seller, listing and marketing specific properties for a commission. Calvia Real Estate does not list, market, or sell any properties directly. Instead, we act as an independent matching layer that connects you to the right agent based on your unique requirements. For buyers, this means access to multiple agencies without contacting each one individually. For sellers, it means your property is channelled to the agent most likely to have qualified buyers in your segment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be physically in Mallorca to use your service?',
    answer: 'No. The entire process is designed to work remotely. You submit your form online, receive agency introductions by email or WhatsApp, and can conduct initial consultations via video call. Many international buyers complete the matching process and even arrange initial viewings before arriving in Mallorca. For sellers, your matched agency can conduct a valuation visit and begin marketing while you coordinate remotely. When it comes time to sign, a Spanish lawyer can represent you via power of attorney if needed.',
