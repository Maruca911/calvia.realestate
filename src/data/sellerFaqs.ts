    question: 'How does Calvia Real Estate match my property with the right agency?',
    answer: `When you submit your seller enquiry form, we analyse your property details — including location, type, size, features, and asking price — against our network of licensed agencies operating in the Calvia municipality. Each agency has specialisations: some focus on luxury villas in Son Vida and Bendinat, others are experts in beachfront apartments in Palmanova and Santa Ponsa, and some handle rural fincas and renovation projects. We match your property to agencies that have active buyer demand in your price bracket and area. Typically, two to three suitable agencies will contact you within 48 hours to discuss a potential listing. You are under no obligation to sign with any of them, and our matching service is completely free for sellers — agencies pay us a referral fee only if a successful sale is completed. This approach ensures you get specialist representation rather than listing with a generalist firm that may not have the right buyer pool for your property.`,

    question: 'What commission do estate agencies typically charge sellers in Calvia?',
    answer: `In Calvia and across the Balearic Islands, the standard agency commission is 5% of the final sale price, plus 21% IVA (VAT) on the commission. So on a property selling for 1,000,000 euros, you would pay approximately 60,500 euros in total agency fees (50,000 euros commission plus 10,500 euros IVA). Some premium agencies or those handling luxury properties may charge lower percentage rates, particularly for high-value transactions above 3 million euros — rates of 3 to 4% are negotiable in that bracket. Conversely, some agencies offering additional services such as professional staging, drone photography, virtual tours, and international marketing campaigns may charge a slightly higher rate. It is important to clarify whether the commission is exclusive (one agency handles the sale) or shared (multiple agencies market the property, splitting the commission). Exclusive mandates often result in better marketing investment from the agency because their fee is guaranteed if the sale completes. Always ensure the commission structure is clearly stated in the written listing agreement (encargo de venta) before signing.`,

    question: 'How is my property in Calvia valued, and what affects the price?',
    answer: `Property valuation in Calvia depends on several interlinked factors. The most significant is location — properties in Bendinat, Son Vida, and Illetes command the highest prices per square metre due to exclusivity, sea views, and proximity to Palma. Other important factors include the property type (detached villa versus apartment versus townhouse), the built area and plot size, the condition and age of the property, energy efficiency rating, outdoor spaces (pool, garden, terraces), parking, and any premium features like direct sea access, a lift, or high-end finishes. A professional valuation typically involves comparing recent sales of similar properties in the same area (comparables), adjusting for differences, and considering current market conditions. In Calvia, the market has shown consistent demand from international buyers — particularly from Germany, the UK, Scandinavia, and increasingly from the US — which supports strong pricing. However, overpricing is the single most common mistake sellers make. Properties priced more than 10% above market value tend to sit on the market, attract fewer viewings, and ultimately sell for less than they would have if priced correctly from the start. A good agent will present you with a comparative market analysis (CMA) before suggesting an asking price.`,

    question: 'What documents do I need to sell a property in Calvia?',
    answer: `To sell a property in Calvia, you need to assemble several key documents. The escritura (title deed) proves your legal ownership. A nota simple from the Land Registry confirms the current registered owner and any charges on the property. You need a valid Energy Performance Certificate (certificado de eficiencia energetica), which is mandatory for all property sales and rentals in Spain and must be obtained from a certified assessor before marketing begins. Your Referencia Catastral (cadastral reference) must be up to date and match the actual built area — discrepancies are common in older properties and must be resolved before sale. You need your most recent IBI receipt (annual property tax, Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) and proof of community of owners fee payments. If the property has undergone renovations, building permits and certificates of completion (licencia de obra and certificado final de obra) are required. A cedula de habitabilidad (certificate of habitability) confirms the property meets minimum living standards. Non-resident sellers must provide their NIE and appoint a fiscal representative. If you have a mortgage on the property, you need a mortgage cancellation certificate or a statement of the outstanding balance for settlement on completion day. Your lawyer will handle the coordination of all these documents, but gathering them early avoids delays.`,

    question: 'Can I sell my Calvia property from abroad without being physically present?',
    answer: `Yes, you can sell a property in Calvia entirely remotely by granting a power of attorney (poder notarial) to a trusted representative, usually your Spanish lawyer. The power of attorney must be executed before a notary — this can be done at a Spanish consulate in your home country or at any notary in Spain if you visit briefly. The document specifically authorises your representative to sign the public deed (escritura de compraventa) on your behalf, receive the sale proceeds, cancel any existing mortgage, and handle all administrative steps including tax payments. Your lawyer will coordinate with the buyer's side, attend the notary appointment on completion day, and ensure the funds are transferred to your designated bank account. Remote sellers should also be aware of the 3% retention rule: when the seller is a non-resident, the buyer is legally obligated to withhold 3% of the purchase price and pay it directly to the Spanish Tax Agency (Agencia Tributaria) as an advance on the seller's capital gains tax. Your fiscal representative then files the final capital gains tax return, and if the actual tax owed is less than the 3% retained, the difference is refunded. This process typically takes 6 to 12 months after the sale.`,

    question: 'What taxes do I have to pay when selling property in Calvia as a non-resident?',
    answer: `Non-resident sellers in Spain are subject to capital gains tax on the profit from the sale. The tax rate for non-residents is a flat 19% for EU/EEA citizens and 24% for non-EU citizens (though tax treaties may modify this). The gain is calculated as the difference between the acquisition cost (purchase price plus documented improvement costs, purchase taxes, and fees) and the sale price (minus selling costs such as agency commission and legal fees). Importantly, the acquisition cost is adjusted for inflation using official coefficients published annually by the Spanish government. Additionally, as mentioned, the buyer withholds 3% of the sale price at completion and pays it directly to the tax office as an advance on your capital gains liability. You must file a declaration within four months of the sale, and any excess retention above the actual tax due will be refunded. Plusvalia municipal (the local land value increment tax) is also payable to the Calvia Town Hall. This tax is calculated based on the increase in the official cadastral land value over your period of ownership, using rates set by the municipality. The calculation method was reformed in 2021, and the new rules generally result in a lower bill. Your lawyer or tax advisor will calculate your exact liability and ensure all filings are made on time to avoid penalties and interest charges.`,

    question: 'How do off-market and discreet property sales work in Calvia?',
    answer: `Off-market sales, sometimes called pocket listings or whisper listings, are relatively common in Calvia's luxury segment, particularly in areas like Son Vida, Bendinat, and Illetes where privacy-conscious owners prefer not to have their properties publicly advertised. In an off-market sale, the agency markets the property exclusively through their private network of qualified buyers, wealth managers, family offices, and trusted partner agencies rather than listing it on public property portals. The advantage for sellers is total discretion — no photographs of your home appear online, no "for sale" signs go up, and viewings are conducted only with pre-vetted, financially qualified buyers. The disadvantage is a potentially smaller pool of interested parties, which may mean a longer time to sell or a slightly lower price compared to full public marketing. However, for genuinely unique or high-value properties, the right buyer often comes through private channels. Some agencies offer a hybrid approach: marketing the property privately for an initial period and, if no sale is agreed, transitioning to a full public listing. When you complete our seller form, you can specify in the "Special Conditions" field that you require a discreet sale, and we will only match you with agencies experienced in handling confidential transactions.`,

    question: 'What is the average time to sell a property in Calvia, and how can I speed it up?',
    answer: `Average selling times in Calvia vary significantly by property type, price point, and location. Well-priced apartments in popular areas like Santa Ponsa and Palmanova typically sell within 2 to 4 months. Villas in the 1 to 3 million euro range in Bendinat or Portals Nous average 4 to 8 months. Luxury properties above 5 million euros in Son Vida or Illetes can take 6 to 18 months due to the smaller buyer pool at that level. To reduce your selling time, consider the following strategies. First and most importantly, price realistically from day one — properties that receive the most viewings and strongest offers in the first 4 to 6 weeks of marketing. Second, invest in professional photography, including aerial drone shots and twilight photography for premium properties. Third, ensure the property is presented at its best: declutter, deep clean, maintain the garden and pool, and consider professional staging for vacant properties. Fourth, have all documentation ready before listing so there are no administrative delays once a buyer makes an offer. Fifth, choose an agency with a strong digital marketing presence and access to international buyer databases, particularly in the German, British, and Scandinavian markets which drive significant demand in Calvia. Flexibility on viewing times, particularly during the busy spring and autumn seasons, also helps maximise exposure to potential buyers.`,

    question: 'Do I need an Energy Performance Certificate to sell my property in Calvia?',
    answer: `Yes, an Energy Performance Certificate (Certificado de Eficiencia Energetica, or CEE) has been mandatory for all property sales and rentals in Spain since June 2013. You must obtain this certificate before you begin marketing the property — it is illegal to advertise a property for sale without displaying the energy rating. The certificate is produced by a qualified architect or engineer who inspects the property and assesses its energy consumption and CO2 emissions based on the building envelope (walls, windows, roof insulation), heating and cooling systems, hot water systems, and lighting. The property is rated on a scale from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). Most older properties in Calvia rate between D and G, while new-builds and recently renovated properties with modern insulation and systems typically achieve B or C. The certificate is valid for 10 years, so if you had one done for a previous rental or sale, it may still be current. The cost of obtaining a CEE ranges from 100 to 300 euros for an apartment and 200 to 500 euros for a villa, depending on the property size. While a low energy rating does not prevent a sale, buyers are increasingly conscious of energy costs, and properties with better ratings may attract more interest and potentially higher offers.`,

    question: 'What about capital gains tax reinvestment exemptions if I am a Spanish tax resident selling in Calvia?',
    answer: `If you are a Spanish tax resident and the property you are selling is your habitual residence (vivienda habitual), you may be fully exempt from capital gains tax if you reinvest the entire sale proceeds into a new habitual residence within two years of the sale. The exemption applies proportionally — if you reinvest 80% of the proceeds, 80% of the gain is exempt. For sellers aged 65 or older, the exemption on the sale of a habitual residence is automatic and complete, with no requirement to reinvest. For non-habitual residences (second homes, investment properties), there is no reinvestment exemption, and the full capital gain is subject to Spain's progressive savings tax rates: 19% on the first 6,000 euros, 21% on gains between 6,000 and 50,000 euros, 23% on gains between 50,000 and 200,000 euros, 27% between 200,000 and 300,000 euros, and 28% above 300,000 euros. Documented improvement costs (renovations with invoices), original purchase costs, and selling expenses (agency fees, legal fees) are deductible from the gain. Properties acquired before 1995 benefit from transitional abatement coefficients that can significantly reduce the taxable gain. These calculations are complex, and we strongly recommend engaging a qualified Spanish tax advisor (asesor fiscal) before listing your property to understand your exact tax position and explore legitimate strategies for minimising your liability.`,
