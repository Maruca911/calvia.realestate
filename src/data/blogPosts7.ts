<h2>Why School Choice Drives Property Decisions in Calvia</h2>
<p>For families relocating to Mallorca, the choice of school is often the single most important factor in deciding where to live. Calvia's position in the southwest of the island gives it excellent access to the highest concentration of international schools in the Balearic Islands. Many of these schools are located within or immediately adjacent to the municipality, meaning families can find properties within a 10 to 20 minute school run across multiple villages.</p>
<p>Importantly, proximity to top-rated international schools has a measurable impact on property values. Estates within the catchment areas of schools like Baleares International College or Agora Portals International School consistently command a 5 to 15% premium compared to equivalent properties further afield. This makes understanding the school landscape essential not just for families but for investors evaluating long-term demand drivers.</p>

<h2>Baleares International College (BIC)</h2>
<p>Located in Sa Porrassa, directly within the Calvia municipality between Magaluf and Palmanova, BIC is one of the most established international schools on the island. It follows the <strong>British National Curriculum</strong> from Early Years through to A-Levels (Sixth Form), making it a natural choice for British families and those seeking a UK-style education.</p>
<p><strong>Key facts for 2025-2026:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ages: 3 to 18 years</li>
<li>Curriculum: British National Curriculum, IGCSEs, A-Levels</li>
<li>Annual tuition: approximately 8,000 to 12,500 euros depending on year group</li>
<li>Languages: English medium with Spanish and Catalan as compulsory subjects</li>
<li>Facilities: science laboratories, sports pitches, swimming pool, performing arts centre</li>
<li>Nearest villages: Palmanova (5 min), Santa Ponsa (8 min), Portals Nous (10 min)</li>
</ul>
<p>BIC has a strong reputation for pastoral care and consistently achieves above-average A-Level results. The school also offers a comprehensive extracurricular programme including sailing, tennis, and horse riding, taking advantage of Mallorca's outdoor lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Agora Portals International School</h2>
<p>Situated in Portals Nous, Agora Portals is a prestigious school offering both the <strong>Spanish national curriculum</strong> and the <strong>International Baccalaureate (IB)</strong> programme. It attracts a diverse student body from over 40 nationalities, creating a genuinely multicultural environment.</p>
<p><strong>Key facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ages: 1 to 18 years (including nursery)</li>
<li>Curriculum: Spanish system with IB Diploma Programme in Sixth Form</li>
<li>Annual tuition: approximately 9,500 to 14,000 euros</li>
<li>Languages: trilingual education in English, Spanish, and Catalan, with German and French as electives</li>
<li>Facilities: Olympic-size swimming pool, music conservatory, robotics lab, theatre</li>
<li>Nearest villages: Portals Nous (3 min), Bendinat (5 min), Costa den Blanes (7 min)</li>
</ul>
<p>The IB Diploma is increasingly valued by European and American universities, making Agora an excellent choice for families who may relocate internationally again or who want their children to have maximum university flexibility. The school's location in Portals Nous also means it draws heavily from the Bendinat and Son Vida communities.</p>

<h2>King Richard III College</h2>
<p>One of the oldest British schools in Mallorca, King Richard III is located in Portals Nous and has been operating since 1986. It follows the <strong>British curriculum</strong> with IGCSEs and A-Levels, and is known for its small class sizes and family atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Key facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ages: 3 to 18 years</li>
<li>Curriculum: British National Curriculum, IGCSEs, A-Levels</li>
<li>Annual tuition: approximately 9,000 to 13,000 euros</li>
<li>Average class size: 15 to 18 students</li>
<li>Nearest villages: Portals Nous (2 min), Bendinat (5 min), Palmanova (8 min)</li>
</ul>
<p>The smaller school size means more individual attention but also a more limited range of A-Level subjects compared to larger institutions. Parents who value a close-knit community and a traditional British educational approach tend to favour King Richard III.</p>

<h2>The Green Valley International School</h2>
<p>Located slightly further east in Palma, Green Valley follows the <strong>British curriculum</strong> and is known for its strong academic results and emphasis on environmental sustainability. The school is approximately 20 minutes from Santa Ponsa and 15 minutes from Palmanova.</p>
<p><strong>Key facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ages: 2 to 18 years</li>
<li>Curriculum: British system, IGCSEs, A-Levels</li>
<li>Annual tuition: approximately 10,000 to 15,000 euros</li>
<li>Special focus: sustainability, outdoor education, STEM</li>
<li>School bus service covering all Calvia villages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deutsche Schule Mallorca (German School)</h2>
<p>For German-speaking families, the Deutsche Schule in Palma offers the <strong>German curriculum</strong> leading to the Abitur. Given the large German expat community in Calvia (particularly in Santa Ponsa, Paguera, and Costa de la Calma), many families choose this school despite the 25 to 35 minute commute from western Calvia villages.</p>
<p><strong>Key facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ages: 3 to 18 years</li>
<li>Curriculum: German state curriculum, Abitur</li>
<li>Annual tuition: approximately 6,500 to 9,000 euros (subsidised)</li>
<li>Languages: German medium with Spanish and English</li>
<li>Recognised by the German Conference of Education Ministers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spanish Public and Semi-Private Schools</h2>
<p>Calvia also has a network of public (free) and concertado (semi-private, subsidised) schools that follow the Spanish curriculum. These schools offer education in Spanish and Catalan, with English as a foreign language. For families planning to integrate fully into Spanish society or who intend to stay long-term, public schooling is a viable and cost-effective option. Notable schools include CEIP Son Ferrer, CEIP Ses Rotes Velles (Santa Ponsa), and IES Calvia secondary school.</p>
<p>The quality of public education in Calvia is generally good, though class sizes tend to be larger (25 to 30 students) and the language transition can be challenging for children who do not speak Spanish or Catalan.</p>

<h2>How School Proximity Affects Property Values</h2>
<p>Our data shows that properties within a 10-minute drive of BIC, Agora, or King Richard III consistently attract higher demand from family buyers. Villages like Portals Nous, Bendinat, and Palmanova benefit directly from their proximity to multiple schools. Santa Ponsa is increasingly popular for families due to its combination of school access, amenities, and relatively affordable pricing compared to Bendinat.</p>
<p>If you are relocating with children and want help finding a property near the right school, <strong>submit your buyer form</strong> and mention your school preference in the notes field. We will match you to agencies who specialise in family relocations and understand the school catchment dynamics.</p>

<h2>Why Property Management Matters in Calvia</h2>
<p>Owning a second home in Mallorca is a lifestyle investment, but it also comes with practical responsibilities. Properties left unattended for months at a time are vulnerable to plumbing leaks, storm damage, pest infestations, and general deterioration. In Calvia's humid Mediterranean climate, even a well-built villa can develop issues if not regularly inspected and maintained. Professional property management ensures your investment remains in excellent condition, retains its value, and is ready for you whenever you arrive.</p>

<h2>What Property Management Services Cover</h2>
<p>A comprehensive property management package in Calvia typically includes the following services:</p>

<h3>Keyholding and Regular Inspections</h3>
<p>The foundation of any management service. A keyholding company holds a set of your keys and conducts regular inspections — typically weekly or fortnightly — to check for water leaks, electrical issues, security breaches, and general wear. After storms, which can be severe in autumn and winter, the manager will inspect for damage and arrange emergency repairs. Expect to pay 80 to 150 euros per month for basic keyholding with weekly checks.</p>

<h3>Pool Maintenance</h3>
<p>If your property has a pool, year-round maintenance is essential. This includes chemical balancing, filtration system checks, cleaning, and winterisation. In summer, pools need attention at least twice per week. Annual pool maintenance contracts in Calvia range from 1,200 to 2,400 euros depending on pool size and whether the property is in use year-round or seasonally. Saltwater pools generally require less chemical management but the systems need specialist servicing.</p>

<h3>Garden and Landscaping</h3>
<p>Mallorca's growing season runs from March to October, and gardens in Calvia can become overgrown quickly. Monthly gardening services (mowing, pruning, irrigation system maintenance, and planting) cost between 150 and 400 euros per month depending on the garden size. Properties with large plots, mature olive trees, or elaborate landscaping will be at the higher end. Irrigation system maintenance is particularly important given periodic water restrictions on the island.</p>

<h3>Cleaning and Pre-Arrival Preparation</h3>
<p>Most management companies offer deep cleaning before your arrival and departure. A standard deep clean for a three-bedroom villa costs 150 to 300 euros. Regular cleaning during your stay (weekly) costs 60 to 120 euros per session. Pre-arrival services can also include stocking the fridge, airing the property, turning on utilities, and heating the pool to your preferred temperature.</p>

<h3>Emergency Repairs and Contractor Coordination</h3>
<p>A good property manager acts as your local representative, coordinating with plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, and builders when issues arise. Most companies charge a management fee (typically 10 to 15% of the repair cost) on top of the contractor's invoice for coordinating and supervising works. Having a trusted local contact who can respond within hours is invaluable when you are thousands of miles away.</p>

<h2>Rental Management for Income Generation</h2>
<p>Many second-home owners in Calvia offset their costs by renting their property when not in use. Rental management adds a layer of complexity:</p>

<h3>Short-Term Holiday Rentals (ETV Licensed)</h3>
<p>If your property holds a valid ETV tourist licence, a rental management company will handle guest bookings, check-ins and check-outs, cleaning between guests, linen supply, platform management (Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo), and guest communication. Commission rates for full-service holiday rental management in Calvia range from 20 to 35% of rental income. Properties in premium locations like Bendinat, Portals Nous, and Son Vida can generate 150 to 500 euros per night in peak season (June to September), with occupancy rates of 70 to 90% during summer months.</p>

<h3>Long-Term Rentals</h3>
<p>For properties rented on long-term contracts (12 months or more), management fees are lower — typically one month's rent as a placement fee plus 8 to 12% of monthly rent for ongoing management. The manager handles tenant screening, contract preparation, rent collection, maintenance coordination, and legal compliance. Long-term rental yields in Calvia range from 3 to 5% gross depending on location and property type.</p>

<h2>Insurance Requirements for Second Homes</h2>
<p>Comprehensive building and contents insurance is essential, and policies for second homes differ from primary residence policies. Key coverage to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building insurance</strong>: covering structural damage, flood, fire, and storm. Typical premiums: 300 to 800 euros per year for apartments, 600 to 2,000 euros for villas.</li>
<li><strong>Contents insurance</strong>: covering furniture, electronics, and personal items. Premiums vary based on declared value.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party liability</strong>: essential if you rent the property, covering guest injuries. Usually included in comprehensive policies.</li>
<li><strong>Unoccupancy clause</strong>: many standard policies void cover if the property is unoccupied for more than 30 to 60 consecutive days. Second-home policies specifically accommodate longer vacancy periods but may charge higher premiums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Popular insurers for second homes in Mallorca include Zurich, AXA, Mapfre, and Linea Directa. Having your property manager conduct regular documented inspections can help meet policy conditions regarding occupancy.</p>

<h2>Tax Obligations for Absent Owners</h2>
<p>Even if you do not rent your property, Spanish tax law imputes income on second homes. Non-resident owners must file an annual tax return (Modelo 210) declaring imputed income of either 1.1% or 2% of the cadastral value (depending on when the value was last revised). The tax rate is 19% for EU/EEA residents and 24% for others. For a property with a cadastral value of 300,000 euros, this could mean a tax bill of approximately 630 to 1,140 euros per year even with zero rental income.</p>
<p>If you do rent the property, rental income is taxed separately. EU/EEA residents can deduct expenses proportionally, while non-EU residents are taxed on gross income without deductions — a significant difference that makes tax structuring important. A fiscal representative (required for all non-residents who own property in Spain) can handle these filings. Annual fiscal representative fees range from 200 to 500 euros.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Property Manager</h2>
<p>When selecting a property management company in Calvia, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local presence</strong>: they should be based in or very near Calvia, able to respond within one to two hours for emergencies</li>
<li><strong>Transparent pricing</strong>: clear monthly fees with no hidden charges for inspections or admin</li>
<li><strong>Contractor network</strong>: established relationships with reliable local tradespeople</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: regular photo reports, accessible by phone and email, multilingual service (English, German, Spanish at minimum)</li>
<li><strong>Insurance and licensing</strong>: the company should carry professional liability insurance and, if managing rentals, be properly licensed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Whether you are buying a property and need to plan for management from day one, or you already own in Calvia and want to optimise your setup, our network includes agencies experienced in recommending trusted property management partners. <strong>Submit your enquiry</strong> and mention property management in your notes — we will ensure your matched agency can advise on both the purchase and the ongoing care of your investment.</p>
