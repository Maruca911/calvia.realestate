<h2>The End of an Era: Spain's Golden Visa Suspension</h2>
<p>In April 2024, Spain's government announced the suspension of the Golden Visa programme, which had allowed non-EU nationals to obtain residency through property investments of at least 500,000 euros. The decision, driven by concerns over housing affordability and speculative buying in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, came into effect for new applications from early 2025. Official details are available on the <a href="https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/en/Paginas/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> consular website.</p>
<p>For prospective buyers eyeing the Calvia municipality — from the hillside estates of <a href="#/blog/son-vida-real-estate-guide">Son Vida</a> to the marina-front apartments of <a href="#/blog/apartments-calvia-guide">Portals Nous</a> — this raised an immediate question: <strong>how can non-EU citizens now obtain Spanish residency through or alongside a property purchase?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is that several viable alternatives exist, each with its own requirements, benefits, and limitations. Below we outline the main options available in 2026.</p>

<h2>1. Non-Lucrative Visa (Visado No Lucrativo)</h2>
<p>The non-lucrative visa is the most common route for retirees and individuals with passive income who want to live in Spain without working. It requires proof of sufficient financial means — typically around 28,800 euros per year for the main applicant (updated annually based on IPREM), plus approximately 7,200 euros per additional family member. You must also hold comprehensive private health insurance valid in Spain and demonstrate a clean criminal record.</p>
<p>This visa is initially granted for one year and renewable for two-year periods. After five years of continuous legal residence, you can apply for permanent residency. The key restriction is that you <em>cannot</em> work or conduct business activities in Spain while holding this visa. It is ideal for retirees, those living off investments or savings, and individuals who work remotely for non-Spanish entities (though this grey area is increasingly scrutinised — see the digital nomad visa below for a clearer solution).</p>
<p>Owning property in Calvia is not a requirement for this visa, but having a rental contract or property deed strengthens your application by demonstrating accommodation arrangements.</p>

<h2>2. Digital Nomad Visa (Visado para Teletrabajo Internacional)</h2>
<p>Introduced under Spain's Startups Law (Ley 28/2022), the digital nomad visa is designed for remote workers employed by or providing services to companies outside Spain. To qualify, you must demonstrate at least one year of professional relationship with the non-Spanish company, earn income primarily from outside Spain, and hold a university degree or demonstrate at least three years of professional experience in your field.</p>
<p>The visa allows you to live in Spain for up to one year initially, renewable for up to five years. A significant benefit is that for the first four years, you can opt into a special tax regime (related to the <a href="#/blog/lex-beckham-ruling-guide">Beckham Law framework</a>) that taxes your Spanish-sourced income at a flat 24% rather than the standard progressive rates. Your non-Spanish income is generally exempt from Spanish tax under this regime.</p>
<p>For buyers in Calvia, this is an attractive route: you can legally reside in Mallorca, work remotely, and benefit from favourable tax treatment while enjoying the lifestyle that Calvia offers. Many digital professionals in the tech, finance, and creative sectors have used this visa to relocate to areas like Santa Ponsa and Palmanova.</p>

<h2>3. Entrepreneur Visa (Visado de Emprendedor)</h2>
<p>If you plan to start or invest in a business in Spain, the entrepreneur visa provides a pathway to residency. The application requires a detailed business plan that must be endorsed by a favourable report from the Spanish government's Invest in Spain office (ICEX). The business must be deemed of economic interest, create jobs, or contribute to innovation.</p>
<p>Real estate-related businesses — such as property management companies, holiday rental operations (with proper <a href="#/blog/short-term-renting-regulations-guide">ETV licensing in the Balearics</a>), or real estate technology firms — can qualify. The visa is initially valid for one year and renewable for two-year periods. After five years, you can apply for permanent residency.</p>

<h2>4. Highly Qualified Professional Visa</h2>
<p>If you receive a job offer from a Spanish company for a senior management or highly qualified technical position, you can apply for a highly qualified professional visa under Spain's large company mobility scheme. The employer must be registered with the Spanish Large Companies Unit (UGE) and the position must meet minimum salary thresholds. While this route is less relevant for property investors specifically, it is worth noting for executives transferring to Mallorca-based companies or opening Spanish subsidiaries.</p>

<h2>5. Long-Term Investment Routes Beyond Property</h2>
<p>While the property-based Golden Visa is suspended, Spain still offers investor visas for other asset classes. A significant investment in Spanish public debt (2 million euros minimum), shares in Spanish companies (1 million euros minimum), or bank deposits in Spanish financial institutions (1 million euros minimum) can still qualify for an investor visa. These thresholds are high, but for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, they provide a straightforward path to residency that can be combined with a property purchase in Calvia.</p>

<h2>What This Means for Calvia Property Buyers</h2>
<p>The end of the Golden Visa has not dampened demand for property in Calvia. International buyers continue to purchase for lifestyle reasons, retirement planning, and long-term capital appreciation. The municipality's fundamentals — limited supply of seafront land, world-class amenities, excellent connectivity via Palma airport, and a stable year-round expat community — remain intact.</p>
<p>The key change is that buyers now need to separate the property purchase decision from the residency decision. Work with an immigration lawyer to determine which visa category fits your circumstances, and engage your property search independently. For UK citizens specifically, our <a href="#/blog/uk-immigration-spain-guide">UK immigration to Spain guide</a> covers the post-Brexit process in detail. Our matching service connects you with agencies experienced in advising international buyers who are navigating these new residency requirements.</p>

<h2>Why Cost of Living Matters for Property Decisions</h2>
<p>When evaluating a property purchase in Calvia, the sticker price is only part of the equation. Your monthly running costs — from IBI property tax and community fees to utilities, groceries, and healthcare — will determine whether your budget is realistic for long-term living or ownership. This guide provides an honest, up-to-date breakdown of what it costs to live in Calvia's various villages in 2026.</p>

<h2>Property Taxes: IBI and Basura</h2>
<p>The <strong>IBI (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles)</strong> is Spain's annual property tax, calculated as a percentage of the cadastral value of your property. In Calvia, the municipal coefficient is approximately 0.62% for urban properties. For a typical apartment with a cadastral value of 200,000 euros, this means an annual IBI bill of around 1,240 euros. For larger villas with cadastral values above 500,000 euros, expect IBI bills between 3,000 and 6,000 euros per year.</p>
<p>The <strong>basura</strong> (rubbish collection tax) in Calvia ranges from 100 to 300 euros annually depending on the property type and zone. These figures are set by the <a href="https://www.ajuntamentdecalvia.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ajuntament de Calvia</a> and reviewed periodically.</p>

<h2>Community Fees</h2>
<p>If you own an apartment or a property within a gated community, you will pay monthly community fees (gastos de comunidad). These cover shared maintenance, pool upkeep, gardening, insurance, and sometimes a doorman or security service. In Calvia, typical community fees range from 100 to 250 euros per month for standard apartment complexes, 200 to 500 euros for premium developments with pools, gyms, and concierge services, and 300 to 800 euros for luxury gated communities in <a href="#/blog/bendinat-real-estate-guide">Bendinat</a>, <a href="#/blog/son-vida-real-estate-guide">Son Vida</a>, or <a href="#/blog/costa-den-blanes-property-guide">Costa den Blanes</a>.</p>

<h2>Utilities: Electricity, Water, Gas, Internet</h2>
<p><strong>Electricity</strong> is the largest utility cost. For a 150 square metre property, expect monthly bills between 80 and 180 euros depending on usage, air conditioning habits, and whether you have solar panels. Mallorca's climate means you will use air conditioning from June to September and heating (usually electric or gas) from December to February. Properties with pools and electric heating can see bills exceeding 300 euros in peak months.</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> in Calvia is supplied by the municipal water company. Average monthly costs are 30 to 60 euros for a household, with surcharges for garden irrigation and pool filling. Water conservation is increasingly important on the island due to periodic droughts.</p>
<p><strong>Gas</strong> (butano or propane tanks, as there is no mains gas network in most of Calvia) costs around 20 to 40 euros per month for cooking and water heating. Some newer developments use aerothermal heat pump systems instead.</p>
<p><strong>Internet and mobile</strong>: fibre broadband is widely available across Calvia's main villages. Packages from providers like Movistar, Vodafone, and Orange cost 35 to 55 euros per month for 600Mbps or 1Gbps connections. Mobile plans range from 15 to 30 euros per month.</p>

<h2>Groceries and Dining</h2>
<p>Grocery shopping in Calvia is comparable to Western European averages. A weekly shop for a couple at supermarkets like Mercadona, Lidl, or Eroski typically costs 60 to 100 euros. Premium supermarkets like El Corte Ingles or organic shops will be 30 to 50% more expensive. Local markets — particularly the weekly market in Calvia Village and Andratx — offer fresh produce, fish, and meats at competitive prices.</p>
<p>Dining out varies widely. A menu del dia (set lunch) at a local restaurant costs 12 to 18 euros including a drink. A dinner for two at a mid-range restaurant in Santa Ponsa or Palmanova runs 50 to 80 euros. Fine dining in Portals Nous or Bendinat can easily exceed 150 euros per couple. Coffee at a cafe costs 1.50 to 3.00 euros.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Spain's public healthcare system is excellent, and registered residents (those with a social security number) receive free or heavily subsidised care. For non-residents and those on non-lucrative visas, private health insurance is mandatory. Annual premiums range from 1,200 to 3,000 euros per person depending on age, coverage level, and insurer. Popular providers include Sanitas, Adeslas, and Asisa. The nearest major hospitals to Calvia are Son Espases (public, 15 minutes from Santa Ponsa) and Clinica Rotger and Hospital Quironsalud (private, in Palma).</p>

<h2>International Schools</h2>
<p>Calvia is home to several international schools, making it a popular choice for families. Annual tuition fees for 2025-2026 are approximately: Baleares International College (BIC) in Sa Porrassa: 8,000 to 12,000 euros. Calvia International School: 7,500 to 10,500 euros. King Richard III College (nearby in Portals Nous): 9,000 to 13,000 euros. The Green Valley International School (Palma): 10,000 to 15,000 euros. Additional costs include uniforms (200-400 euros), lunch (1,200-1,800 euros per year), and school bus transport (1,500-2,500 euros per year). For a full comparison of curricula, locations, and fees, see our <a href="#/blog/international-schools-calvia-mallorca-guide">international schools guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>Most residents in Calvia own a car, as public transport, while improving, does not cover all villages conveniently. Petrol costs around 1.50 to 1.70 euros per litre. Annual car insurance ranges from 400 to 1,200 euros depending on the vehicle. The TIB bus service connects Palma to most Calvia villages, with single fares between 2 and 4 euros. A monthly bus pass for unlimited travel within zones costs approximately 40 to 55 euros. Taxis from Palma airport to Santa Ponsa cost 35 to 50 euros.</p>

<h2>Village-by-Village Cost Comparison</h2>
<p>Not all villages in Calvia are equal in terms of living costs. Here is a relative comparison:</p>
<p><strong>Son Vida & Bendinat</strong> — The most expensive. Higher IBI (larger properties), premium community fees, and luxury dining options. Budget 4,000 to 8,000 euros per month total living costs for a family (excluding mortgage).</p>
<p><strong>Portals Nous & Illetes</strong> — High-end but slightly more varied. Expect 3,000 to 6,000 euros per month depending on lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Ponsa & Palmanova</strong> — Mid-range with good value. Excellent amenities, competitive grocery shopping, and family-friendly. Budget 2,500 to 4,500 euros per month.</p>
<p><strong>Paguera & Costa de la Calma</strong> — Generally the most affordable within Calvia. Lower property prices mean lower IBI and community fees. Budget 2,000 to 3,500 euros per month.</p>
<p><strong>Calvia Village</strong> — Authentic Mallorcan living at lower prices than coastal areas. Limited dining options but excellent value. Budget 1,800 to 3,000 euros per month.</p>

<h2>Summary: What to Budget</h2>
<p>For a couple without children living in a mid-range area like Santa Ponsa, expect total monthly costs of approximately 2,500 to 3,500 euros (excluding rent or mortgage). For a family of four with international schooling, budget 4,500 to 7,000 euros per month in areas like Bendinat or Portals Nous. These figures assume a moderate lifestyle — eating out twice a week, one car, and standard utility usage.</p>
